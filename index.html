                My Experience with HTML and CSS: I have good experience as a business analyst where I have come across HTML and CSS quite a few times, but do not have any hands-on experience. Since taking this course, I have been exploring the field of Front End Software development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and believe me I am enjoying this. I hope to learn a lot more and keep on exploring newer technologies while having a good firm on the basics of these technologies.
